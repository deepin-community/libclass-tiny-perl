libclass-tiny-perl (1.000-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  From upstream Changes:

    [*** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ***]

    - Attributes for custom accessors *MUST* be declared for them to be
      set via the constructor.  It is no longer sufficient for a method of
      the same name to exist.

    - Unknown constructor arguments are ignored rather than fatal; they are
      not included in the object.  Special instructions for using BUILD to
      hide constructor arguments from validation are irrelevant and have
      been removed.

    - These changes make Class::Tiny-based classes easier to subclass by
      more advanced object frameworks like Moose or Moo.
